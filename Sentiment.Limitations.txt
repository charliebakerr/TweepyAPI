Limitations 
Twitter API requests limited to 900 / 15mins
Enterprise API acc allows more and also allows engagement metrics such as impressions and replies
Tweepy limits scraping to 18000 data points per 15 mins

Sentiment Algo
Scaled on follower count, this doesnot however account for fake followers, can create bot to validate real followers.
Unable to pull correct reply metrics without enterpirse api access, this has reulted in inaccurate algo based on likes and rt's only

Unit testing
If more time, would unit test the algo and also look at including some NLP using textBlob and look at polarity and subjectivity and review insights recieved from these.

df.query
I use df.query, this calls on the API through the df, it is possible to make twitter do the work for you using the since_id in the api.user_timeline, this is however cumbersome and slow and not as clean as calling on 86400 time since

Create algo to backtest tokens mentioned and test token price performance vs past high impact tweets and understand dynamics of movement.

Algo to predict impressions/view data:
Look at rate of change of sentiment rather than sentiment alone, to predict high sentiment tweets.
New impact metric to get rate of change of rate of change of sentiment, this will give indication of alpha and potential opportunites, - alpha will dilute by more viewers/ engagement, could pair with an emergence score or something similar
